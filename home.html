                I don’t believe that what you do defines who you are, but what drives you to particular 
                roles is what defines you. I am curious and love learning. I’m an action-taker. I am 
                caring, loyal and honest. I love personal development. These qualities drive my passion 
                for yoga, meditation and mentorship.
                <br><br>
                I have practiced yoga for about 10 years now. Yoga has had a huge impact on my life  - 
                it has gotten me through a lot of hard times, provided self-discovery and deepened my 
                relationship with myself. To further my practice, I did a teacher training in 2018 to 
                become a certified yoga teacher and am currently an RYT-200 and certified in Yin.
                <br><br>
                Besides teaching yoga and meditation, I work as a Software Engineer and have a Master’s 
                degree in Bioengineering. I am passionate about increasing the number of women in STEM 
                fields and aim to help working, professional women prevent burnout, achieve work-life 
                harmony, and feel empowered in all aspects of life.
                <br><br>
                I look forward to connecting with you and leading you on a journey of self-discovery!

                            Vinyasa = connection of movement + breath. Expect a gradual progression of 
                            poses and sequences. We start slow and work through each pose individually 
                            to work on alignment, often holding poses for a few breaths. Once we have our 
                            alignment, we progress into one breath per movement and get in a flow.

                            Power vinyasa is very similar to vinyasa described, but expect to sweat more and 
                            be more challenged. This class works on stamina, strength, flexibility and endurance 
                            whereas vinyasa focuses mostly on flexibility. We will still flow, but plan to pause 
                            for specific strengthening moves such as ab exercises to strengthen our core.

                            Plan to sit still (in a comfortable position) to open and focus your mind in order to 
                            observe your thoughts and feelings without judgement. This powerful practice is a great 
                            manifestation tool and can help you clear your thoughts, become calm, increase 
                            self-awareness, reduce stress and negativity, and find inner peace.

                            Meditation is a practice and skill to develop, so it may take time to get comfortable 
                            sitting still with your mind. Remember, the journey is more important than the destination.

                            Yin is considered the opposite to Vinyasa yoga which can often be considered as a “yang” style 
                            of yoga. Unlike vinyasa which focuses on your muscles, yin yoga focuses on deep connective tissues. 
                            Yin is a slower, more meditative practice where most poses are held for 3-5min and sometimes longer.

                            As the name suggests, this class is a combination of both Vinyasa and Yin practices. The first half 
                            of the class is Vinyasa to warm up the body and release extra energy to prepare you to lengthen muscles 
                            and relax during Yin in the second half of the class. This style class is a perfect way to get curious 
                            about what Yin has to offer for those who typically practice Vinyasa.
