                    I don’t believe that what you do defines who you are, but what drives you to particular 
                    roles is what defines you. I am curious and love learning. I’m an action-taker. I am 
                    caring, loyal and honest. I love personal development. These qualities drive my passion 
                    for yoga, meditation and mentorship.
                    <br><br>
                    I have practiced yoga for about 10 years now. Yoga has had a huge impact on my life  - 
                    it has gotten me through a lot of hard times, provided self-discovery and deepened my 
                    relationship with myself. To further my practice, I did a teacher training in 2018 to 
                    become a certified yoga teacher and am currently an RYT-200 and certified in Yin.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides teaching yoga and meditation, I work as a Software Engineer and have a Master’s 
                    degree in Bioengineering. I am passionate about increasing the number of women in STEM 
                    fields and aim to help working, professional women prevent burnout, achieve work-life 
                    harmony, and feel empowered in all aspects of life.
                    <br><br>
                    I look forward to connecting with you and leading you on a journey of self-discovery!
